Sorting Algorithm animated
==========================

This program uses a deck of 52 cards to demonstrate bogo and insertion sort methods. The bogo method uses a shuffle function on an array of the numbers from 0-51, displays the cards based on the  and then checks it against a sorted array. If it does match (roughly a 1 in 8x10^67 chance per try) an alert will pop up and the bogo function will stop running.

The insertion sort uses a function that iterates over the function from left to right, moving smaller numbers toward index 0 until they run into a number smaller than them. The array updates and jQuery is used to swap the pictures of cards to correspond with the array. Unfortunately, despite hours of trying I was unable to slwo down the process enough so the shiftingis visible, and instead you press the button and it isalmost instantly sorted.
